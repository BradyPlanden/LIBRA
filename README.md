# LithIum-ion Battery Realisation Algorithms (LiBRA)

## Create and Simulation Reduced Order Lithium-Ion Battery Models
LiBRA provides an open-source implementation of realisation algorithms commonly used for generating reduced-order state-space models.
For more information on the current derived transfer functions used to represent the lithium-ion cell, please refer to [1](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2007.03.015), [2](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.07.075).
